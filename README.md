# As if by magic: self-supervised training of deep despeckling networks with MERLIN
Two documents with additional results on TerraSAR-X images in stripmap mode and in spotlight mode
are provided in the *Additional_results* folder.

The Git repository **will be soon updated** with the weights of the trained models and
a notebook allowing to easily do some tests on custom images.
